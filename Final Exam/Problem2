Consider the following code:

import random, pylab
xVals = []
yVals = []
wVals = []
for i in range(1000):
    xVals.append(random.random())
    yVals.append(random.random())
    wVals.append(random.random())
xVals = pylab.array(xVals)
yVals = pylab.array(yVals)
wVals = pylab.array(wVals)
xVals = xVals + xVals
zVals = xVals + yVals
tVals = xVals + yVals + wVals
For each of the following questions, select the best answer from the set of choices.


Problem 2-1
2/2 points (graded)
The values in tVals are most closely: Distributed with a Gaussian distribution

Problem 2-2
2/2 points (graded)
The values in xVals are most closely: Uniformly distributed correct

Problem 2-3
2/2 points (graded)
pylab.plot(xVals, zVals) - graph5

Problem 2-4
2/2 points (graded)
pylab.plot(xVals, yVals) - graph4

Problem 2-5
2/2 points (graded)
pylab.plot(xVals, sorted(yVals)) - graph3

Problem 2-6
2/2 points (graded)
pylab.plot(sorted(xVals), yVals) - graph2

Problem 2-7
2/2 points (graded)
pylab.plot(sorted(xVals), sorted(yVals)) - graph1
