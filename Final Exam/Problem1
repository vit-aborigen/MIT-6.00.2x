Consider two normal distributions, A and B. The standard deviation of A is 3 and the standard deviation of B is 5. For each distribution, 1,000 observations are drawn and plotted in a histogram with 10 bins, creating one histogram for each distribution.

The rightmost bin of A will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of B.
The rightmost bin of B will have fewer points than the rightmost bin of A.
The rightmost bin of A will have the same number of points as the rightmost bin of B.
Any of the above are possible.

You want to calculate confidence intervals by applying the empirical rule, which requires that you have a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. Which approach can you use to estimate the mean and standard deviation that you need? Choose all that work.

Central Limit Theorem, which requires that you have many sufficiently large samples from the population
Standard Error, which requires that you have one sufficiently large sample
